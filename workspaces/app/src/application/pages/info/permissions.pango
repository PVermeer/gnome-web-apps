<b>filesystem=xdg-data/applications:create</b>
Used to create new Web Applications. Usually resolves to ~/.local/share/applications.

<b>filesystem=~/.var/app:create</b>
Used to create isolated profiles for flatpak browsers. For some flatpak browsers
it's necessary to create a directory in their sandbox for profile isolation.
The app cannot break out of it's own filesystem so this application needs to break in.

For example the Firefox based browsers don't create the isolated profile
directory and will fail when the directory doesn't exist.

System installed browsers isolated profiles are saved in our own xdg-data/profiles directory.

<b>filesystem=xdg-data/flatpak/app:ro &amp; filesystem=/var/lib/flatpak/app:ro</b>
Used to fetch the icons of the flatpak browsers.

<b>talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak</b>
Used to run commands outside of the sandbox. This is needed to fetch flatpak browser information and to run the created Web App from this application.
